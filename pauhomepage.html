    <h3> My Creative Statement! </h3>
    <p>
      Like many, I have consumed media my whole life. Being able to create 
      and share my ideas with strangers and my peers is something that has 
      always brought me happiness. I love contributing to a community and 
      bonding over shared interests.
      The types of media I want to know more about includes video game 
      design/programming and 2d animation. Making people feel seen and happy 
      through my work is what brings me joy!
