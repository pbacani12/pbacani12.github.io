    <!-- Paragraph abt image -->
    <p>
        I chose this image because I loved how the backrest of the bench looked like.
        The color makes the bench look old, which reminds me that Hunter had welcomed many 
        different people throughout many years.
        <br>
        I tried to use an L-shape composition technique for this image.
